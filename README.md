### Description 
This project involved creating a Node.js application that utilizes the 'Inquirer' package to ask the user a series of prompts that then feed into a templated README document. The goal of the application is to quickly produce a high-quality, professional README file for projects that always has the appropriate formatting and minimum required content. It utilizes several confirmation prompts and conditional questions based on those prompts to ensure your README has the content you need. 

### Installation 
This application currently is not published and available to be installed.

### Usage 
To use this application:
1. Navigate to the corresponding directory in your terminal
2. Run ```node index.js```
3. Input the appropriate content for each prompt
4. Enjoy your freshly-minted README file

### Additional notes:
- This README itself was generated using the generator of this project, effectively highlighting the majority of the output of the application.
- Future updates to the project will include:
   - Switching to the 'editor' prompt for the Description to support multi-line content in that section, as well as make it easier to include screenshots
   - A conditional prompt to specify the filename if the user wants or needs to use a filename other than README.md
   - Conditional prompts for 'Links' and 'Additional notes' so user can add content for those sections if necessary
   - Improvements to overall formatting of the template
   - Publishing as an installable package that can be installed and used in any project
